## Notes

### Organising code
### DOM

* [ng-include](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngInclude)
* If you are manipulating the DOM, always use a directive
* always use [angular.element](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element) to access the DOM

### Gotchyas
* [ng-include expects an expression, strings must be explicit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12521905/angularjs-ng-include-does-not-include-view-unless-passed-in-scope)

### Servers
